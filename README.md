# ntr_overlay_samples
Sample overlay plugins for NTR CFW. 

Overlay plugin is a plugin that has ability to "postprocess" the game's screen while playing games. For example, drawing a clock widget on the top of the game's screen.


# Clock
Draw a transparent widget to display time and battery status on the top screen.


# Usage
Copy .plg files to /plugin/game folder in the sdcard. The overlay plugins will take effect after starting games.

Precompiled .plg files could be found at https://github.com/44670/ntr_overlay_samples/releases
